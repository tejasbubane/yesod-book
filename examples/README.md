# Example Apps

These are some very basic single file example yesod apps. All taken from the
[yesod book](https://www.yesodweb.com/book-1.6/).

This repo contains `stack.yml` which uses system ghc. Install `yesod` in global namespace using:

```sh
stack install yesod yesod-bin
```

Then run examples using `runghc`:

```sh
stack runghc helloworld.hs
```
